# LMA_QC
This repository is for holding basic scripts for parsing and examining 
log files associated with LMA stations, currently including the daily, 1 
second summary logs for each station, the voltage log for any station as 
compared to the West TX Mesonet and the log of station status messages 
received by the LMA server every 30 minutes.
